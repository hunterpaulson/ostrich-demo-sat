# ostrich-demo-sat
Demo Satellite implemented in F Prime

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to practice implementing the skills that we (hunterpaulson and zchoffma) learned in the JPL F Prime workshop in Summer 2019. 
In order to demonstrate our knowledge we have built and programmed a small demo satellite on a raspberry pi. The satellite has an IR Receiver, a temperature and humidity reader, and a LCD 16x2 Display board. The LCD board displays the temp and humidity data as well as commands received from the IR Receiver via serial communication from an Arduino.  

Architecture:
F Prime (F'): an open source flight software framework developed by JPL in California specifically for small to medium satellites.

Languages Used:
C/C++

Libraries:
wiringPi

Why Ostrich?:
This satellite is codenamed 'project ostrich' because, much like its animal counterpart, this satellite will never leave the ground.

Developers:
Zachary Hoffmann (zchoffma)
Hunter Paulson (hunterpaulson)
