# ostrich-demo-sat
Demo Satellite implemented in F Prime

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to practice implementing the skills we (hunterpaulson and zchoffma) learned in the JPL F Prime workshop in Summer 2019. 
In order to demonstrate our knowledge we have built and programmed a small demo satellite on a raspberry pi. The satellite has an IR Receiver, a temperature and humidity reader, and a LCD 16x2 Display board. The LCD board displays the temp and humidity data as well as commands received from the IR Receiver.  

Programming Languages:
F Prime (F') is a programming language developed by JPL in California specifically for small to medium satellites.
C++, F Prime is written is C++ 

Libraries:
wiringPi

Why Ostrich?:
This satellite is codenamed 'project ostrich' because much like its animal counterpart this satellite will never leave the ground.
