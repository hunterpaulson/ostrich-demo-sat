| INSTANCE NAME                 - Name of the instance object.                                                                      |
| BASE ID (HEX)                 - Base ID set for the instance.                                                                     |
| REQUESTED WINDOW SIZE         - Specified by either the 'base_id_range' attribute in the instance tag or by finding the max of th |
|                                 e 'base_id_range' attribute in the topology tag and the largest internal ID of the instance.      |
| DIFFERENCED ID WINDOW SIZE    - Calculated by subtracting the current base ID from the next base ID.                              |
| LARGEST COMPONENT INTERNAL ID - The largest ID found in the events, channels, and commands of the instance.                       |
| MAX AMOUNT OF IDS             - The largest amount of items from either events, channels, or commands.                            |
