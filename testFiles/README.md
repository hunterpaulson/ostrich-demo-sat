THIS FOLDER IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT WORK WITHOUT WIRINGPI IN THE FOLDER

Since this is a learning experience for us, many of the functions we implemented 
were first tested in their own files which can be found here.  The code is messy and
may not work, however, the fully functional code can be found in the ostrich.cpp file.

These files are also undocumented as they were rapidly developed, please refer to the 
ostrich.cpp file for plain implementation documentation.
